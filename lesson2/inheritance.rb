# 1. Create a sub-class from Dog called Bulldog overriding the swim method to return "can't swim!"

class Dog
  def speak
    'bark!'
  end

  def swim
    'swimming!'
  end
end

class Bulldog < Dog
  def swim
    "Can't swim!"
  end
end

teddy = Dog.new
puts teddy.speak           # => "bark!"
puts teddy.swim           # => "swimming!"


# 2. Create a new class called Cat, which can do everything a dog can, except swim or fetch.
#    Assume the methods do the exact same thing.
#    Hint: don't just copy and paste all methods in Dog into Cat; try to come up with some class hierarchy.

class Pet
  def run
    'running!'
  end

  def jump
    'jumping!'
  end
end

class Dog < Pet
  def speak
    'bark!'
  end

  def fetch
    'fetching!'
  end

  def swim
    'swimming!'
  end
end

class Cat < Pet
  def speak
    'meow!'
  end
end

pete = Pet.new
kitty = Cat.new
dave = Dog.new
bud = Bulldog.new

pete.run                # => "running!"
pete.speak              # => NoMethodError

kitty.run               # => "running!"
kitty.speak             # => "meow!"
kitty.fetch             # => NoMethodError

dave.speak              # => "bark!"

bud.run                 # => "running!"
bud.swim                # => "can't swim!"

# 3. Draw a class hierarchy diagram of the classes from step #2

=begin
Pet: run, jump -> Cat: speak
               -> Dog: speak, fetch, swim -> Bulldog: swim
=end

# 4. What is the method lookup path and how is it important?

=begin
The method lookup path shows us the order in which Ruby looks for methods to invoke.

# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

=begin
My answers:
-Allows you to organize code into namespaces or containers
-Allows you to section off areas of code so that if you need to add or change something
in your code you just have to change it in one place instead of multiple places
-allows for a new level of abstraction
-allows you to use polymorphism and you can represent your data in different ways
-objects represented as nouns are easier to follow

LS's answers:
Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
